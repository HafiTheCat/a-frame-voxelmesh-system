# ðŸ‘‹Hi
Back in **2022**, when I was doing some game development, I thought it would be a good idea to put together a voxelmesh generator.
To reduce the number of faces to render, it is common practice to remove unnecessary/unvisible faces from cubes.

It allows the creation of cube positions and colors that can be generated with a single material through the use of vertex attributes, allowing a shader to color them all in a single render call.

Here's an example: [Open Visual](https://hafithecat.github.io/a-frame-voxelmesh-system/).

`npm install`

`npm run dev`
